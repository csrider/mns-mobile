Note:

Even though this module is loaded from our own custom yui.messagenet directory, 
"it" (specifically the YUI seed file) seems to always want to load this module's
CSS file from the default YUI directory -- this results in nothing working,
because the client/browser cannot find the file.

If you update YUI, you must make sure this module's CSS file is still inside
the main YUI directory.

Specifically,
./assets/skins/sam/gallery-sm-menu/
